# About me

Hi! I'm [Erik](https://en.pronouns.page/@Captain8771) (He/Him) and I code silly things that *somehow* work, after like 800 attempts and 9 cups of coffee.

## Projects I've worked on:

| Name | Repo | Comment |
| ---- | ---- | ------- |
| Vencord | [vendicated/vencord](https://github.com/vendicated/vencord) | Made a plugin (CustomRPC) |
| AOUutils | [Captains-Ship/AOUutils](https://github.com/captains-ship/aouutils) | This repo is the old codebase. |
| Cap's Random Stuff | [Captain8771/random-mod](https://github.com/Captain8771/random-mod) | This is my minecraft mod, adding some minor nice things. |
| Random HTML stuff | [On this site](https://captain8771.github.io/random-stuff) | I make these mostly for fun
