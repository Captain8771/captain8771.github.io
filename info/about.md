# About me

Hi! I'm [Erik](https://en.pronouns.page/@Captain8771) (He/Him) and I code silly things that *somehow* work, after like 800 attempts and 9 cups of coffee.

## Projects I've worked on:

| Name | Repo | Comment |
| ---- | ---- | ------- |
| Vencord | [vendicated/vencord](https://github.com/vendicated/vencord) | Made a plugin (CustomRPC. See: [The doc I made about CustomRPC](/docs/customrpc.md))
| AOUutils | [Captains-Ship/AOUutils](https://github.com/captains-ship/aouutils) | I am the original creator of AOUutils |
| \*checks commit history\* | OH COME ON IS THAT EVERYTHING?!?! | damn it's sad my only public experience is a discord client mod and a dead discord bot
