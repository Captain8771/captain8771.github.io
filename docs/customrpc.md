## CustomRPC in Vencord: How to use it.

### What is CustomRPC?

---

CustomRPC is a plugin for Vencord that allows you to set a Custom Rich Presence, as seen in the following image:

### How do I use CustomRPC?

---

First, enable the plugin.

Now, you will want to open its settings

You should now see something like this:

Go to https://discord.com/developers/applications, and click "New Application" in the top right corner.

You will be greeted with a popup on creating an application. Pick a name (can be whatever), agree to the terms of service and developer policy, and click create.

Now that you have your application, copy the ID and put into the first settings field ("The ID of the application for the rich presence.")

From here, it should be pretty straight-forward, just set your settings, reload, and boom! You have a custom rich presence.


### How do I add images?

---

Images are a bit weird when. They support image links, yes, but discord is horrible at telling you if it's invalid, merely greeting you with this:

![picture of invalid image](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1085178975791349792/1087775334071545886/image.png?width=139&height=117)

A common mistake people make when using imgur links is they link the page that shows the image, not the actual image.

This is how you get the link to the actual image (the link you *need* to use for it to work):

![TODO: Write alt text](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1085178975791349792/1087776786076676166/image.png?width=672&height=639)

And now you can use that in your rich presence!

### My question wasn't answered here!

Send a message in the vencord #support channel asking the question, and (optionally) ping me (Captain#3175) and I'll add the answer.

Have a nice day!
