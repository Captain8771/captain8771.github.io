# Bandager
## What the hell is a bandager???
[Bandager](https://github.com/captain8771/bandager) is a new service similar to usrbg, where you can get your own banner, animated avatar, and even badge, for free, AND visible to other bandager users!

*[visible to other bandager users]: Not visible to those without bandager.

Bandager is currently in beta, and testing is open [at the Bandager discord](https://discord.gg/EvB9PYD5Pt)! Any help is greatly appreciated. 

## When will Bandager release?
There is no eta, but there are a few (non-exhaustive) criteria I would like to meet:
- Tested at least semi-thouroughly.
- Ported to [Vendetta](https://github.com/vendetta-mod).
- Submitting avatars, banners, and badges being possible from both [Vendetta](https://github.com/vendetta-mod) and [Vencord](https://github.com/vendicated/vencord).

## How can I help?
Join the discord, and ping me (@Captain#3175).
